# BlogVue

In this project, you can create blog posts and delete whatever you want. 
You can also go to the new entry page and switch between pages. With the keep alive feature, your articles in the new entry section are not deleted.
A useful structure is provided with Vue components, props and events.

After adding a transition, the transition between pages becomes soft.
